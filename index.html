            8/20/23 - This is my first journal entry, we worked on a lot this week. First we started off by starting our website so you can see it.
            This was major in my books because this was the first time ive coded since 6th grade. We also learned the safey rules and engineering 
            process which we have to study for next week's quiz. We also did our first challege which included cut pvc pipes and a marble. My group 
            came up with the idea of if we had it higher and slowed it down in the process it would get into the bucket. Which worked 4 times 
            3 out of the 4 times we missed the bucket but as the other half of the class went inside, our group stayed and almost made it in, a 
            finger or two got into the way of the bucket unfortunetly. :(
