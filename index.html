             <h1>Week 1</h1>
        <p>
            8/21-8/24 "Week 1" <br> This is my first journal entry, we worked on a lot this week. First we started off by starting our website so you can see it.
            This was major in my books because this was the first time ive coded since 6th grade. We also learned the safey rules and engineering 
            process which we have to study for next week's quiz. We also did our first challege which included cut pvc pipes and a marble. My group 
            came up with the idea of if we had it higher and slowed it down in the process it would get into the bucket. Which worked 4 times 
            3 out of the 4 times we missed the bucket but as the other half of the class went inside, our group stayed and almost made it in, a 
            finger or two got into the way of the bucket unfortunetly. :(

            <h1>Week 2</h1>
    
        <p>
            8/28-8/31 "week 2"<br> This is my second journal entry, we didnt work on machines a lot but we did learn about mechanical engineering and
            how to tinkercad!!! We learned that mechaical engineering is the oldest and broadest engineering there is and there is subcatagories that
            go with it. It's pretty intresting to know that this one engineering field can be so massively spread out. We also learned how to tinker cad and 
            while I have tinkered a little in this website once, it was still a fun experice. For my second project on this website I made an oven
            and it was pretty cool if I do say so myself.

            <h1>Week 3</h1>
        
        <p>
            9/5-9/8 "week 3"<br> This is my third journal entry, we did a lot of coding this week. We worked on our Rube Goldberg experiment where
            we are rolling down a baseball to hit a car that will make the pully lift up and hit the ballon. While we finished our cad we started
            our contrustion on the build. Keenan and I worked on the math and measurements of the build and our other group members started to 
            cut the carboard. We finished the stilts for the first platform that will hold the baseball. Im very excited to start the contrustion
            of our machine.
