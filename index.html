             <h1>Week 1</h1>
        <p>
            8/21-8/24 "Week 1" <br> This is my first journal entry, we worked on a lot this week. First we started off by starting our website so you can see it.
            This was major in my books because this was the first time ive coded since 6th grade. We also learned the safey rules and engineering 
            process which we have to study for next week's quiz. We also did our first challege which included cut pvc pipes and a marble. My group 
            came up with the idea of if we had it higher and slowed it down in the process it would get into the bucket. Which worked 4 times 
            3 out of the 4 times we missed the bucket but as the other half of the class went inside, our group stayed and almost made it in, a 
            finger or two got into the way of the bucket unfortunetly. :(

            <h1>Week 2</h1>
    
        <p>
            8/28-8/31 "week 2"<br> This is my second journal entry, we didnt work on machines a lot but we did learn about mechanical engineering and
            how to tinkercad!!! We learned that mechaical engineering is the oldest and broadest engineering there is and there is subcatagories that
            go with it. It's pretty intresting to know that this one engineering field can be so massively spread out. We also learned how to tinker cad and 
            while I have tinkered a little in this website once, it was still a fun experice. For my second project on this website I made an oven
            and it was pretty cool if I do say so myself.

            <h1>Week 3</h1>
        
        <p>
            9/5-9/8 "week 3"<br> This is my third journal entry, we did a lot of coding this week. We worked on our Rube Goldberg experiment where
            we are rolling down a baseball to hit a car that will make the pully lift up and hit the ballon. While we finished our cad we started
            our contrustion on the build. Keenan and I worked on the math and measurements of the build and our other group members started to 
            cut the carboard. We finished the stilts for the first platform that will hold the baseball. Im very excited to start the contrustion
            of our machine.

            <h1>Week 4</h1>
        
        <p>
            9/11-9/13 "week 4"<br> This is my fourth journal entry, we finished our Rube Goldberg experiment. Its small but mighty!!! 
            throughout the building process we tested every chance we got. With the limited resources(the car and the baseball) that everyone
            wanted at the same time to test there experiments. After all the failed and successful attempts of testing it we were unable to 
            finish the experiment this week.

        <p>
            9/18-9/21 "week 5"<br> This is my fifth journal entry, this week we finished our Rube Goldburg experiment and got it to FINALLY work.
            It was a long and stressful monday but we got it complete. On Tuesday we completed one challege a water boat that for mine only lasted
            45 seconds and started and finished on Thurday an E project where we had to be extremely specific and write down every measurement
            for each side. After we completed and judged the E's we started to learn computuer engineering. Which entails electrical and 
            computer engineering. YAYYA :)

            <h1>Week 6</h1>
        
        <p>
            9/25-9/28 "week 6"<br> This is my sixth journal entry, this week we finished our E project which did not go to plan for some people.
            But it was still fun, then on wensday we disected a computer which was very fun. Seeing where the different components connect to 
            make a machine actually work is cool. You could see the motherboard up close and see the transistors and Cpu/Gpu. It was a very fun
            week this week with all the wires and rebuilding the computer again. It has inspired me to possibly building my own computer one day.

            <h1>Week 7</h1>
        
        <p>
            10/1-10/6 "week 7"<br> This is my seveth journal entry, this week we learned about a new engineering branch called bioengineering. 
            This branch of engineering is about prostetics and how to manipulate the different tissues in our bodys with machines.
            This was very intresting to me because I enjoy seeing how different parts of the body function together and how one machine can be 
            used to help a person gain a little of that ablity back. We also did a lab where we created a claw just like robotic hands and was
            actually functional. My partner and I decided on a hand that had rope attached to "fingertips" that created almost a grip like the 
            Gecko claw so that it could optain the waterbottle with efficiency.

            <h1>Week 8</h1>
        
        <p>
            10/9-10/12 "week 8"<br> This is my eighth journal entry, this week we learned about aerospace engineering. Its a branch of engineering
            that focuses on making rockets. I learned about the 2 different branches in Aerospace engineering which is aeronautical engineering which
            is about airplanes and staying in earths orbit while Astronautical Engineering is about satalites and space ships. Also its easier
            to get into bigger companies. You also get a lot of money when you go into this field. We also made cad desgins of a spaceships.
            I took the height of the soda can and added a couple more for the head and then added diagnal fins so it will make it turn faster.

            <h1>Week 9</h1>
        
        <p>
            10/16-10/20 "week 9"<br> This is my ninth journal entry, this week we tested and built our plane. My partner and I built a aerodynamic plane
            which we thought would be perfect. While neither of us knew what we were doing we thought of a cool desgin and went with that. Unfortnatly,
            i got the head cold and was unable to be there when they tested but i got videos. Ours did great on the desgin factor not so much going far.
            If we had more time i would fill the bottle more up with water and do a lighter material to build out of.
